// ABOUTME: Workflow orchestration patterns for complex agent task execution.
// ABOUTME: Sequential, parallel, conditional, and loop workflows with script support.
// Package workflow provides orchestration patterns for executing complex agent
// tasks. It implements various workflow types including sequential, parallel,
// conditional, and loop-based execution patterns.
//
// Key features:
//   - Sequential workflow for ordered task execution
//   - Parallel workflow for concurrent task processing
//   - Conditional workflow for branching logic
//   - Loop workflow for iterative operations
//   - Script step integration for dynamic workflows
//   - Template system for reusable workflow patterns
//   - Serialization support for workflow persistence
