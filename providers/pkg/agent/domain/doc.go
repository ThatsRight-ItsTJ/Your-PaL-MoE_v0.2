// ABOUTME: Domain types and interfaces defining the agent framework contracts.
// ABOUTME: Core abstractions for agents, tools, state, events, and workflows.
// Package domain defines the core types, interfaces, and contracts for the agent
// framework. It establishes the fundamental abstractions used throughout the
// agent system without any implementation details.
//
// Key interfaces and types include:
//   - Agent and Tool interfaces
//   - State management and validation
//   - Event types and streaming
//   - Context and handoff mechanisms
//   - Guardrails and safety constraints
//   - Configuration structures
