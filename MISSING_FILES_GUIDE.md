# Missing Files Guide

## Files That Failed to Download

Some files from the original development plan were not available. Here's what you can do:

### ZukiJourney API-OSS Files (404 Errors)
The original repository structure has changed. Alternatives downloaded:
- `core/routing_engine_base.ts` - Use g4f routing logic instead
- `api/openai_compatible_base.py` - Use official OpenAI Python client
- `core/auth_middleware_base.py` - Implement basic FastAPI middleware
- `core/provider_manager_base.py` - Use g4f provider patterns

### Uplink Retry Files (404 Errors)
- `resilience/retry_base.py` - Replaced with Tenacity library (better alternative)

### Microsoft Prompt/FLAML Files (404 Errors)
- `optimization/prompt_optimizer_base.py` - Use Guidance library instead
- `optimization/genetic_algorithm_base.py` - Use Optuna for optimization

## Recommended Implementations

1. **For routing logic**: Implement a simple FastAPI-based router
2. **For retries**: Use Tenacity library (already downloaded)
3. **For prompt optimization**: Implement basic A/B testing
4. **For provider management**: Use the g4f patterns as reference

## Next Steps

1. Review downloaded alternatives
2. Implement missing critical components
3. Focus on core functionality first
4. Add advanced features incrementally
